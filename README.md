# Sorting Algorithms
The sorting algorithms project focuses on implementing and comparing the performance of two popular sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and Quick Sort. The goal is to understand their working principles, analyze their time complexity, and evaluate their efficiency in sorting a given dataset. The dataset and problem were created for the purpose of this comparison.
